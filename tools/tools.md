### [HGSS Safari Zone Encounter Slot Calculator](/tools/safari-zone-calc/index.html)

A webtool used to calculate the encounter slots in the HGSS Safari Zone given the block scores. The tool takes the blocks and time of day to output the encounter slots in any zone!

### [BB Code to HTML](/tools/bb-to-html/index.html)

This tool converts a block of BB-Code to HTML, useful for converting a forum post into a on-site article. However, with a little tweaking, the output could be used as any html page.

### [IV to PID Applet](/tools/iv-to-pid/index.html)

In the Gen 3 and Gen 4 Pokemon games, the IVs are tied to the PID. This online tool allows you to use a Pokemon's nature and IVs to calculate its PID. If the Pokemon is shiny, you can also get your SID!

### [Dream Radar Calculator](/tools/dream-radar/index.html)

This tool simplifies the process of RNGing the Dream Radar by calculating the number of advances you need to do to reach your target IV frame. The starting frame in the researcher and final PID frame are provided as well. Please refer to my in-depth [guide](https://www.smogon.com/ingame/rng/bw_rng_part8) on the RNG process for more info.

### [RS Seed2Time](/tools/seed2time/index.html)

This simple tool converts the starting seed for a live-battery Ruby/Sapphire game into a time. You can then use that time to hit your target initial seed.

### [SWSH TR Finder](/tools/tr-finder/index.html)

The location of any TR in the Wild Area is provided with this tool. Simply enter in your desired TR or ball and determine when and where a Trader will have it, or which raids can drop it.

### [Pokemon GO Weather Searcher](/tools/go-weather/index.html)

GWS is a webtool used to lookup the latitude/longitude coordinates of a specific weather condition used within Pokemon GO. With the click of a single button, you can find the current weather from any of the top 150 cities around the world!
