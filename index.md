Welcome to my collection of tools and resources that I've made, and found, over the years. Everything is hosted on my GitHub (including this site!), so please feel free to [suggest edits](https://github.com/shinyfinder/shinyfinder.github.io) directly on GitHub or contact me at any of my socials listed at the bottom of the pages. While I'm just a hobbyist, I do my best to make each project robust and user friendly. Enjoy your stay!

Here is a highlight of the things *you* can find here:

## [Tools](/tools/tools.md)

A collection of webtools that I've made to assist in topics from manipulating the RNG in the Pokemon games to converting bb-code to proper HTML. Each project is open source and hosted on my GitHub, linked in the footer of each page.

## [Swiss Bracket Manager](/tools/swiss/index.html)

A full-featured webtool for managing Swiss tournaments. Extensions, byes, substitutions, and Win/Loss management are just a few of the supported features. Each bracket is stored within your browser and saved automatically, which means you can come back at any time and pick up where you left off. While the tool is specifically designed for Smogon tournaments in mind, feel free to use it for anything.

## [Pokemon Encounter Slots](/encounter-slots/slots.md)

The original and most-accurate source for encounter slots on the web is now hosted on GitHub! Originally on Google Sites, I decided to migrate everything over into one place. The tables for every mainline game from Gens 1-8 are provided, allowing users to quickly look up route information when RNGing.
