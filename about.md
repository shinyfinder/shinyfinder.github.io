Usually called sf for short, I spend a lot of my time in the Pokemon communities. The games have been a part of my life for the last 25 years, so I decide to spend my hobby time giving back to the community and providing resources for others to enjoy the games too. I enjoy a challenge and building webtools, so why not combine the two?

Over time, links die, tools get lost, and the original devs move on. So in addition to making my own contributions, I try to rehost and maintain the projects the community has come to rely on. My website has been the go-to resource for encounter slot information within the Pokemon games for the last 10 years, being the only extensive and most complete (and accurate!) source on the web. Other contributions include:

* [Various web calculators](./tools/tools.md) featured in several guides.
* A [management tool](./tools/swiss/index.html) for maintaining Swiss Tournaments
* A webpage to lookup [current weather conditions](./tools/go-weather/index.html) for Pokemon GO
* And many more

At the moment, I'm mostly working on developing and maintaining a [Discord bot](https://github.com/shinyfinder/chatot-smogon) for the Smogon Univeristy community, but I never know what need will pop up next.

I hope you enjoy the tools as much as I've enjoyed working on them. While I'm just a hobbyist, I do my best to make each project robust and user friendly. While by no means necessary, a [sponsorship](https://github.com/sponsors/shinyfinde) is a deeply appreciated way to say thank you and to encourage and enable me to expand my horizons and improve my offerings. Thanks for reading!
